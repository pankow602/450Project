Project Name: Butternut Valley Ice Delivery Report System

Project Description:
	This project will be implemented to record the 
	data collected from sales information. currently
	there is no system in place for this company to 
	record the information from their sales. This system will be 
	used to store data such as amount of ice sold, to whom, where
	are they located, and who sold the ice to them. There will also 
	be a login system so users other than the manager may have 
	access to some of the information.
